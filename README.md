# Universal-Vitals-Research-Project
## ðŸ“Œ Project Intention
This module is part of the **Universal Vitals Internship Project**.  
The goal is to understand and analyze how a person walks (their **gait**) using simple sensors.  
By studying movement patterns, we can detect if a personâ€™s walking style shows **imbalance, weakness, or health issues**.  
This will help in building smart health monitoring systems for **elderly people, patients, and rehabilitation** use.
