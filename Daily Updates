TASK 1: 23/10/25

ðŸŽ¥ Activity:
Watched a YouTube video on "Medical Device Product Development" to understand the complete process involved in designing, testing, and validating medical devices.

ðŸ“š Learning Summary:

Gained insight into the different stages of medical device development, from ideation, design, and prototyping to regulatory approval and post-market monitoring.

Understood the importance of user needs, risk management, and usability engineering in medical device design.

Learned how proper documentation and design control ensure safety, reliability, and compliance of medical products.

ðŸ©º New Product Development Process (Reference):

Concept & Feasibility
Identify the medical or clinical need, study available technologies, and assess practical feasibility.

User Requirements (URS)
Define the intended use, target users, user needs, and overall design plan.

Design Inputs
Specify functional, safety, and regulatory requirements that the product must meet.

Design & Development
Create and refine prototypes while documenting all design outputs.

Design Verification
Test and confirm that design outputs meet the specified design inputs.

Design Validation
Ensure the developed device meets actual user needs and performs its intended function.

Design Transfer
Prepare the finalized design for manufacturing and create production documentation.

Production & Process Validation
Validate the manufacturing process and quality control methods to ensure consistency.

Regulatory Submission
Compile all necessary documentation and submit it for regulatory approval or clearance.

Post-Market Surveillance
Monitor device performance, collect feedback, manage complaints, and implement improvements.

ðŸ§  Next Step:
Plan to research existing fall detection systems in the current market, comparing their cost, features, and limitations to identify possible areas for improvement in our project.
