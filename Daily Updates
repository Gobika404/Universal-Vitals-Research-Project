TASK 1: 23/10/25

### ðŸŽ¥ Activity:
Watched the YouTube video on **"Medical Device Product Development"** to understand the complete process involved in designing, testing, and validating medical devices.

### ðŸ“š Learning Summary:
- Gained insight into the **different stages of medical device development** â€” from ideation, design, and prototyping to regulatory approval and post-market monitoring.  
- Understood the importance of **user needs, risk management (ISO 14971)**, and **usability engineering (ISO 62366)** in medical device design.  
- Learned how proper documentation and design control ensure **safety, reliability, and compliance** of medical products.
  
## ðŸ©º New Product Development Process (Reference)

### 1. Concept & Feasibility  
Identify the medical or clinical need, study available technologies, and check if the idea is practically feasible.

### 2. User Requirements (URS)  
Define the intended use, target users, user needs, and overall design plan.

### 3. Design Inputs  
Specify functional, safety, and regulatory requirements that the product must meet.

### 4. Design & Development  
Create and refine prototypes while documenting all design outputs.

### 5. Design Verification  
Test and confirm that design outputs meet the specified design inputs.

### 6. Design Validation  
Ensure the developed device meets actual user needs and performs its intended function.

### 7. Design Transfer  
Prepare the finalized design for manufacturing and create production documentation.

### 8. Production & Process Validation  
Validate the manufacturing process and quality control methods to ensure consistency.

### 9. Regulatory Submission  
Compile all necessary documentation and submit it for regulatory approval or clearance.

### 10. Post-Market Surveillance  
Monitor device performance, collect feedback, manage complaints, and implement improvements.

### ðŸ§  Next Step:
Plan to research the **existing fall detection systems** in the current market, comparing their **cost, features, and limitations** to identify possible areas for improvement in our project.
